# LAB 1 AM Modulation & Radio

## Objective of the Lab 
This lab aim to accomplish the following using GNURadio Software and SDR Radio Reciver Kit: 

+ Build an AM Radio 
+ Abillty to tune to differnet radio staions
+ Contain a visual graphical user interface (GUI)
+ GUI contains Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and waterfall visual representation

These few block contains the setup of the project file as well as the variables used in the AM Radio. Speciccly the GUI Range blocks are
specficlly useful for having user inputs that can be changed while running the the programs. All that is need is to have the start, stop , and step
size  of the variable that we wish to adjust while in the program.
